### Project Title:
Barley GS Training Population Optimization Simulation

### Description:
The objective of this project is to determine the dynamics of updating a training population and the long-term impact on a closed breeding program. We aimed to compare several methods of training population updating in terms of prediction accuracy, response to selection, and decay of genetic variance.
