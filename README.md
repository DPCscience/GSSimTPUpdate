# GSSimTPUpdate

### Project Title:
Evaluating Methods of Updating Training Data in Long-Term Genomewide Selection

### Description:
The objective of this project is to determine the dynamics of updating a 
training population and the long-term impact on a closed breeding program. 
We aimed to compare several methods of training population updating in terms of 
prediction accuracy, response to selection, and decay of genetic variance. This 
R package provide the code and data to run the simulation and create the figures 
used in the paper.

### Installation
To install, use the `devtools` package like so:
```
devtools::install_github("UMN-BarleyOatSilphium/GSSimTPUpdate")
```

### Obtaining Data
We used data from The Triticeae Toolbox data base in our simulations. A step-by-
step set of instructions for obtaining and downloading this data is provided
in a package vignette. Call on the function:
```
browseVignettes("GSSimTPUpdate")
```

To access the vignette.
